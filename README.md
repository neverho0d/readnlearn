# ReadNLearn - Intelligent Text Reader with SRS Learning

A cloud-first text reader and phrase book with offline cache and cloud providers (LLM/MT/TTS) for memorizing via Spaced Repetition System (SRS) and cloze deletions.

## Overview

The core concept is to create an intelligent reading assistant that transforms any text into a personalized learning experience. When you encounter unfamiliar phrases while reading, you can capture them with a simple selection, and the application will:

- **Automatically translate and explain** the phrase using AI-powered translation services, using the phrase context to get the best possible translation
- **Create personalized study cards** based on your proficiency level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2)
- **Target specific learning difficulties** - select areas where you typically struggle (e.g., tense/aspect, gender agreement, word order, prepositions)
- **Personalized explanations** - AI focuses explanations on your selected difficulty areas for more targeted learning
- **Schedule spaced repetition** to ensure long-term retention through scientifically-proven SRS algorithms

This transforms passive reading into active learning, building your vocabulary and comprehension systematically while maintaining the natural flow of reading.

ReadNLearn is an application that helps you learn foreign languages through contextual phrase capture and AI-powered study sessions.

### The application provides

- **Two-pane reading interface** with synchronized text and phrase panels
- **Smart phrase capture** with automatic translation and explanation
- **AI-powered study sessions** with cloze exercises and story generation
- **Spaced repetition system** for optimal learning retention
- **Cloud-first architecture** with offline caching for seamless experience

### Key Features

- **Reading Mode**: Load text files, select phrases, and save them with automatic translation
- **Dictionary Mode**: Search, filter, and manage your saved phrases with advanced full-text search
- **Learning Mode**: Practice with AI-generated cloze exercises and contextual stories
